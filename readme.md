## Description

Telegram bot for conducting your personal movie rating. Allows you to search by the name of the movie, 
add it and set the rating, as well as display information about the added movies. This bot is based on the 
API of the Russian service - Kinopoisk. Also, all commands are output in the bot in Russian. If desired, 
you can adapt it to English - you will only have to change the API and translate commands into English 
(Google translator to help), and add .env file for API-KEY and BOT-TOKEN.
